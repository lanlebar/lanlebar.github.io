#Mlin transport website
I've made a website for a local company in the transport business. Their old website was really bad, so I figured I could make some money on the side and make them a cool looking website.

## Features and tech
- Made in HTML, CSS and JS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for interactive maps
- [FormSubmit](https://www.formsubmit.co) used for forms on the site (so forms actually post). Forms also support file uploads - drag and drop functionality is included for a smooth UX
- Available in English and Slovenian language
