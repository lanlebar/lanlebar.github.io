# [Mlin transport website](https://lanlebar.github.io/)
I've made a website for a local company in transport business. Their old website was really bad, so I figured I could make some money on the side and make them a cool looking website.s\

## Features and tech
- A static website, made in HTML, CSS and JS
- Bootstrap framework - I figured it's a little too heavy - gotta learn Tailwind ASAP :)
- All forms on the site use [FormSubmit](https://www.formsubmit.co) 
- Forms also support file uploads - drag and drop functionality included for a smooth UX
- Available in English and Slovenian language (it's a Slovenian company)
